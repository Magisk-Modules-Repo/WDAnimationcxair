# BootAMoji Switcher

## Description

All the real and official three versions of WatchDogs boot animation and some other cool boot animations purely extracted from their source for any supported android device.

Changes the bootanimation animation and shutanimation to watchdogs and some other cool boot animations with the one you want from all the available boot animations included in this module.

You can select from all the available boot animation or shutdown animation using your volume key during installation. As simple as that!

## Can I request another cool boot or shut animation ?

Yes, You can request boot animation or shut animation using my Telegram account below then I will try to add support for your device on future updates.

## Is shutdown animation is supported by all devices?

No, It's device specific.

## ANNOUNCEMENT!!

ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED ON THIS MODULE AND WANT TO MAKE HIS DEVICE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THIS MODULE CAN CONTACT ME USING MY TELEGRAM ACCOUNT BELOW THEN I CAN ADD SUPPORT FOR YOUR DEVICE IN FUTURE UPDATES.

## What can I do if I want to change my choice ?

If you want to change your choice again flash the module twice from TWRP or Magisk Manager then module becomes uninstalled in the first flash and you can choice again with the second flash.

## Can I see preview of the animations included in this module?

No, b/c it's only a script.

## What about Samsung phones having their boot animation in .qmg format?

This module doesn't support them totally. Find a custom ROM that uses the formal .zip extension, then we can continue with it.

## What Can I do if I want to change the animation or emoji style or to completely uninstall it?

If you want to uninstall the module disable it from the Magisk Manager app or reflash the module again whether in TWRP or Magisk Manager. Flash three times to change what you choose before.
